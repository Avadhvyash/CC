<!--------

We have an amazing community of users that would love to help you troubleshoot issues. 

You can reach out to them here:
StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-material2
Gitter: https://gitter.im/angular/material2
Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular-material2

We want to keep issues open only for bug reports and feature requests. However, we understand that 
it is not always clear whether an issue is caused by a bug or incorrect usage of a feature/component.

You are welcome to ask for our help, but please be aware that we have very limited bandwidth. 

We can only assist if we can understand the problem and quickly reproduce the issue. Otherwise, we 
may close the issue and request that you ask for help from the community instead.

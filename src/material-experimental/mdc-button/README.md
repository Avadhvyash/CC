### Open Issues

- Disabled FAB does not look disabled
- Anchor button does not look disabled
- No focused state
- Icon buttons are not colored by theme

### TODO
- Write README - looks like lot of overlap with checkbox README. Create common readme for setup
- Move tests over
- JSDoc comments on all classes, consts
- Consider supporting button[mat-outlined-button]

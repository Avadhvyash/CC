    <!--

        TODO for review: In that case it's quite weird because with the async pipe
        the expression can evaluate to "null". The "[ngForOf]" input type does not accept
        "null" so it fails the strict Ivy template check... At runtime it works because
        there is a simple "truthy" check in the NgForOf directive... but the current
        type is incompatible and seems like it can become a general impacting issue with Ivy.

        For reference: there are issues for the async pipe which could also return "undefined".
        See: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/16982
